# ACWA-Data
Virginia Tech's A3 lab's ACWA datasets (AI &amp; Cyber for Water &amp; Agriculture)

The ACWA lab is a cyber-physical testbed comprising a cluster of computational resources, CPUs, GPUs, sensors, water tanks, pumps, valves, pipes, and soil beds. The main goal of the ACWA lab is to address pressing challenges in the water and agricultural domains by utilizing cutting-edge AI and cyber technologies.
